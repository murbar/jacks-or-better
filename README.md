# Jacks or Better

A little poker game build with React. Hopefully it shows a broad range of skill. Fun to go wild with fonts/color/animations, even sound. Game UI is often more of a challenge than your typical CRUD app.

## Technologies & tools

- React (hooks)
- Mobile-first, fully responsive & scoped CSS with `styled-Components`
- Automated testing of core logic and gameplay with `react-testing-library`
- Randomized decks with Crypto API
- Sound effects with Web Audio API
- Routing with `react-router`
- Animations with CSS and `react-spring`
- Original graphics produced with Sketch
- SVG minimization with `svgo`
- Automated deployment with Netlify

## Issues

- Need to fix the Bet & Deal buttons: CSS translate giving the depth effect is affecting the click target - button is moved up but target stays in place
